      "heading": "Why we made this product",
      "body": "Magnesium plays a crucial role in over 300 biochemical reactions in the body, including muscle function, energy production, protein synthesis, and reducing fatigue. Athletes, especially those engaged in high-intensity activities, are often at risk of magnesium deficiency. Ultra Magnesium helps to optimize recovery, maintain electrolyte balance, and improve sleep quality—essential elements of long-term athletic performance.\nAthletes, especially runners, are prone to muscle soreness, joint discomfort, and inflammation caused by intense physical activity. Puresport's Freeze Roll-On was developed to provide immediate and targeted relief through a potent formula that combines CBD with Menthol, Arnica, and other natural ingredients known for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. This fast-absorbing, non-greasy formula allows for quick application and relief, making it an essential part of any post-run or workout recovery routine."
