      "heading": "How to Take",
      "body": "For optimal results, take 1 capsule daily with water, preferably in the morning. Athletes should consider regular supplementation, especially during the winter months or periods of reduced sun exposure.\nOur Vitamin D3+K2 supplement is of higher strength (Vitamin D3 4000IU). If you find the 4000IU strength too high, you can opt to take them once every 2-3 days instead of daily. This approach can be effective because both Vitamin D3 and K2 are fat-soluble, meaning they can be stored in the body's fat tissues and liver for future use."
