      "heading": "Why we made this product",
      "body": "Lion’s Mane has been used for centuries in traditional medicine for its cognitive and neurological benefits. In today’s fast-paced world, where mental performance is just as important as physical performance, athletes and active individuals require supplements that not only support the body but also the mind.\nWe created the Vitamin D + K2 supplement for athletes and individuals who may be deficient in these essential vitamins. Low Vitamin D levels can impact muscle recovery, bone strength, and immune function.\nPaired together, this bundle is the perfect combination to support both cognitive performance and build immunity."

    },
    {
      "heading": "How to take",
      "body": "Lions Mane:\nFor optimal results, take 2 capsules daily with food to aid absorption. Due to its cognitive-enhancing effects, it is best taken in the morning to support mental clarity and focus throughout the day.\n4000IU Vitamin D3 + K2:\nFor optimal results, take 1 capsule daily with water, preferably in the morning. Athletes should consider regular supplementation, especially during the winter months or periods of reduced sun exposure.\nOur Vitamin D3+K2 supplement is of higher strength (Vitamin D3 4000IU). If you find the 4000IU strength too high, you can opt to take them once every 2-3 days instead of daily. This approach can be effective because both Vitamin D3 and K2 are fat-soluble, meaning they can be stored in the body's fat tissues and liver for future use."
