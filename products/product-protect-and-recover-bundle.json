      "body": "Supercharge your recovery with Muscle and Joint Freeze Roll-On, formulated with 1000mg of CBD and a blend of natural oils to provide fast, targeted relief for sore muscles and joints, and support bone health and immune function, using our vegan-friendly 4000IU Vitamin D3 + K2."

      "heading": "Why we made this product",
      "body": "We created the Vitamin D3 + K2 supplement for athletes and individuals who may be deficient in these essential vitamins. Low Vitamin D levels can impact muscle recovery, bone strength, and immune function. Puresport's Freeze Roll-On was developed to provide immediate and targeted relief through a potent formula that combines CBD with Menthol, Arnica, and other natural ingredients known for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. This fast-absorbing, non-greasy formula allows for quick application and relief, making it an essential part of any post-run or workout recovery routine.\nTogether, the Protect and Recover bundle provides recovery from muscle soreness, joint discomfort, and inflammation caused by intense physical activity, as well as protection against illness and injury by strengthening muscles, bones and the immune system."

    {
      "heading": "How to take",
      "body": "Apply the Freeze Roll-On directly to the affected area up to 3-4 times per day. The roll-on applicator allows for precise, mess-free application, making it perfect for targeting specific muscle groups or joints after a workout.\nTake 1 capsule of Vitamin D3 + K2 daily with water, preferably in the morning. Athletes should consider regular supplementation, especially during the winter months or periods of reduced sun exposure. Our Vitamin D3+K2 supplement is of higher strength (Vitamin D3 4000IU). If you find the 4000IU strength too high, you can opt to take them once every 2-3 days instead of daily. This approach can be effective because both Vitamin D3 and K2 are fat-soluble, meaning they can be stored in the body's fat tissues and liver for future use."
