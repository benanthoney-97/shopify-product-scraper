# Cognitive and Immunity Bundle
Handle: cognitive-and-immunity-bundle
Vendor: Puresport
Type: Vitamins & Supplements
Tags: Bundle; Cognitive; filter:Recovery; focus; hide_subcriptions; immunity; MushroomsNootropics; Recovery; Supplement; YGroup_LionsMane
Variant: Default Title | SKU:  | Barcode: 
Price: £55.00


## Description
Strengthen mind and body with the Cognitive Support Bundle, supporting bone health, immunity, cognitive function and stress management.

## Why we made this product
Lion’s Mane has been used for centuries in traditional medicine for its cognitive and neurological benefits. In today’s fast-paced world, where mental performance is just as important as physical performance, athletes and active individuals require supplements that not only support the body but also the mind.
We created the Vitamin D + K2 supplement for athletes and individuals who may be deficient in these essential vitamins. Low Vitamin D levels can impact muscle recovery, bone strength, and immune function.
Paired together, this bundle is the perfect combination to support both cognitive performance and build immunity.

## Full Ingredients list
Lions Mane:
Lion's Mane (8:1 Extract) 3000mg
Including: Polysaccharides 75mg
Including: Beta-Glucans 75mg
Including: Triterpenes 75mg
4000IU Vitamind D3 + K2:
Vitamin D3: 4000 IU
Vitamin K2 (MK-7): 100mcg
HPMC (Empty Capsule Shell)
Brown rice flour
Bamboo silica
Allergen warning: may contain soya

## How to take
Lions Mane:
For optimal results, take 2 capsules daily with food to aid absorption. Due to its cognitive-enhancing effects, it is best taken in the morning to support mental clarity and focus throughout the day.
4000IU Vitamin D3 + K2:
For optimal results, take 1 capsule daily with water, preferably in the morning. Athletes should consider regular supplementation, especially during the winter months or periods of reduced sun exposure.
Our Vitamin D3+K2 supplement is of higher strength (Vitamin D3 4000IU). If you find the 4000IU strength too high, you can opt to take them once every 2-3 days instead of daily. This approach can be effective because both Vitamin D3 and K2 are fat-soluble, meaning they can be stored in the body's fat tissues and liver for future use.

## Shipping and returns

100% PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE. Not right for you after 30 days? No problem, we'll refund you.

With the constant physical and mental demands placed on athletes and active individuals, the need for effective stress management is crucial. Chronic stress can lead to fatigue, reduced performance, and impaired recovery, all of which negatively impact athletic goals.
We paired this with Lion's Mane, which has has been used for centuries in traditional medicine for its cognitive and neurological benefits. In today’s fast-paced world, where mental performance is just as important as physical performance, athletes and active individuals require supplements that not only support the body but also the mind.

# Intro Runner's Bundle
Handle: intro-runners-bundle-skio
Vendor: Puresport
Type: hidden
Tags: Bundle; filter:Hydration; filter:Performance; has_free_item; hidden; immunity; Performance; Supplement; YGroup_introrunner
Variant: Default Title | SKU: PSB-INTRORUNNER-BUNDLE | Barcode: 
Price: £53.00


## Description
Designed as the perfect introduction to natural supplements for runner's, the Runner's Intro Bundle supports strong bones and faster recovery with Vitamin D3 + K2, and optimises hydration with Ultra Electrolytes - helping you feel your best every step of the way.

## Why we made this product
We created the Vitamin D + K2 supplement for athletes and individuals who may be deficient in these essential vitamins. Low Vitamin D levels can impact muscle recovery, bone strength, and immune function. With this product, we aim to ensure that athletes and active individuals are provided with a high-quality, plant-based Vitamin D3 and K2 formula, tailored for their needs.
Hydration is crucial for maintaining performance, particularly during intense or prolonged physical activity. Electrolytes like sodium and potassium are essential to prevent dehydration and muscle cramps, which are common issues in endurance sports. Puresport’s Ultra Electrolytes  is designed to keep athletes hydrated, improve endurance, and support muscle function with a sugar-free, refreshing citrus formula.
Together, the Intro Runner's Bundle provides the perfect supplements to start your running journey, optimising hydration and supporting bone, muscle and immunity to help prevent injury.

## Full ingredients list
Vitamin D3: 4000 IU
Vitamin K2 (MK-7): 100mcg
HPMC (Empty Capsule Shell)
Brown rice flour
Bamboo silica
Allergen warning: may contain soya
Ultra Electrolytes Discovery Pack:
Sodium (Chloride) 1000mg

Magnesium (Citrate) 100mg
Calcium (Malate) 50mg
Zero Sugar
Natural Sweetener (Steviol Glycosides)*
Natural Raspberry Flavouring
Natural Lemon & Lime Flavouring & Natural Orange Flavouring

## How to take
For optimal results, take 1 capsule of Vitamin D3+K2 daily with water, preferably in the morning. Athletes should consider regular supplementation, especially during the winter months or periods of reduced sun exposure.
Mix one sachet of Ultra Electrolytes  with 500ml of water 30 minutes before exercise for optimal hydration. During prolonged or high-intensity activities, an additional sachet may be consumed to replace electrolytes lost through sweat. Do not exceed 2 sachets per day without consulting a medical professional.

## Description
Ease soreness and inflammation with our Muscle and Joint Essentials, offering targeted relief and soothing comfort for muscles and joints.

## Why we made this product
Athletes, especially runners, are prone to muscle soreness, joint discomfort, and inflammation caused by intense physical activity. Puresport's Freeze Roll-On was developed to provide immediate and targeted relief through a potent formula that combines CBD with Menthol, Arnica, and other natural ingredients known for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. This fast-absorbing, non-greasy formula allows for quick application and relief, making it an essential part of any post-run or workout recovery routine.
The Muscle and Joint Balm was designed to address these needs, offering a natural, soothing balm that harnesses the power of CBD and essential oils known for their anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties.
Our formulation also emphasises recovery and post-exercise care, aiding muscle and joint recovery to keep individuals performing at their best. With the addition of essential oils and natural waxes, this balm provides not only relief but also nourishment for the skin, making it ideal for regular use.

## Description
Supercharge your recovery with Muscle and Joint Freeze Roll-On, formulated with 1000mg of CBD and a blend of natural oils to provide fast, targeted relief for sore muscles and joints, and support bone health and immune function, using our vegan-friendly 4000IU Vitamin D3 + K2.

## Why we made this product
We created the Vitamin D3 + K2 supplement for athletes and individuals who may be deficient in these essential vitamins.

This fast-absorbing, non-greasy formula allows for quick application and relief, making it an essential part of any post-run or workout recovery routine.
Together, the Protect and Recover bundle provides recovery from muscle soreness, joint discomfort, and inflammation caused by intense physical activity, as well as protection against illness and injury by strengthening muscles, bones and the immune system.

Vitamin D3: 4000 IU
Vitamin K2 (MK-7): 100mcg
HPMC (Empty Capsule Shell)
Brown rice flour
Bamboo silica
Allergen warning: may contain soya

## How to take
Apply the Freeze Roll-On directly to the affected area up to 3-4 times per day. The roll-on applicator allows for precise, mess-free application, making it perfect for targeting specific muscle groups or joints after a workout.
Take 1 capsule of Vitamin D3 + K2 daily with water, preferably in the morning. Athletes should consider regular supplementation, especially during the winter months or periods of reduced sun exposure. Our Vitamin D3+K2 supplement is of higher strength (Vitamin D3 4000IU). If you find the 4000IU strength too high, you can opt to take them once every 2-3 days instead of daily. This approach can be effective because both Vitamin D3 and K2 are fat-soluble, meaning they can be stored in the body's fat tissues and liver for future use.

## Description
Puresport’s Tongkat Ali is crafted from potent Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma Longifolia) extract, known for supporting testosterone levels, improving stress resilience, and enhancing exercise performance. The addition of Piperine improves bioavailability, helping your body absorb the active compounds more effectively.

## Why we Made this Product
Testosterone is crucial for maintaining energy levels, libido, muscle mass, and physical performance, especially as testosterone levels naturally decline from the age of 30. Additionally, Tongkat Ali’s compounds may help reduce cortisol, a stress hormone that can negatively impact recovery and overall well-being. Puresport's Tongkat Ali is designed for individuals aiming to improve hormone health, boost performance, and reduce stress.

## Full Ingredients List
Tongkat Ali Extract (Eurycoma longifolia) (from 400mg of a 40:1 extract of eurycomanone)
Piperine 5mg

Type: hidden
Tags: hidden; Supplement; YGroup_VitD3
Variant: 1 Refill Bag | SKU: PSC-VITD3-REFILL-14CAPS | Barcode: 5061015796109
Price: £10.00


## Description
This supplement is designed to support bone health, immune function, and cardiovascular health, featuring 4000 IU of Vitamin D3 sourced from marine algae and 100mcg of Vitamin K2. This formulation ensures optimal calcium absorption while promoting strong bones and a healthy heart. Suitable for vegans, this product is ideal for athletes looking to maintain peak performance.

## Why we made this product
We created the Vitamin D + K2 supplement for athletes and individuals who may be deficient in these essential vitamins. Low Vitamin D levels can impact muscle recovery, bone strength, and immune function. With this product, we aim to ensure that athletes and active individuals are provided with a high-quality, plant-based Vitamin D3 and K2 formula, tailored for their needs.

## Full Ingredients List
Vitamin D3: 4000 IU
Vitamin K2 (MK-7): 100mcg
HPMC (Empty Capsule Shell)

## How to Take
For optimal results, take 1 capsule daily with water, preferably in the morning. Athletes should consider regular supplementation, especially during the winter months or periods of reduced sun exposure.
Our Vitamin D3+K2 supplement is of higher strength (Vitamin D3 4000IU). If you find the 4000IU strength too high, you can opt to take them once every 2-3 days instead of daily. This approach can be effective because both Vitamin D3 and K2 are fat-soluble, meaning they can be stored in the body's fat tissues and liver for future use.

Free UK Shipping on subscriptions and orders over £50.
100% PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE. Not right for you after 30 days? No problem, we'll refund you.
